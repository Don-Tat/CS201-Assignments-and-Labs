Final Exam

1. Write a recursive method that will compute cumulative sums in an array. To find the cumulative
sums, add to each value in the array the sum of the values that precede it in the array. For
example, if the values in the array are [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 7], the result will be [2, (2) + 3, (2 + 3) + 1,
(2 + 3 + 1) + 5, (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) + 6, (2 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 6) + 2, (2 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 2) + 7] or [2, 5, 6,
11, 17, 19, 26]. Hint: The parenthesized sums in the previous example are the results of a
recursive call.

2. Create a class SongCard that represents a gift card for the purchase of songs online.
    It should have the following private attributes:
        • songs—the number of songs on the card
        • activated—true if the card has been activated and the following methods:
        • SongCard(n)—a constructor for a card with n songs.
        • activate()—activates the gift card. Throws an exception if the card has already been activated.
        • buyASong()—records the purchase of one song by decreasing the number of songs left for
        purchase using this card. Throws an exception if the gift card is either completely used or not
        active.
        • songsRemaining()—returns the number of songs that can be purchased using the gift card.

3. Write some code that will use an iterator to duplicate every item in an instance of
StringLinkedListWithIterator (that we used in our lecture). For example, if the list contains "a",
"b", and "c", after the code runs, it will contain "a", "a", "b", "b", "c", and “c”.
