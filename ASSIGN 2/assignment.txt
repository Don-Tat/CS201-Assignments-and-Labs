Assignment 2
Write a grading program for an instructor whose course has the following policies:
• Two quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points, are given.
• One midterm exam and one final exam, each graded on the basis of 100 points, are given.
• The final exam counts for 50 percent of the grade, the midterm counts for 25 percent, and the
two quizzes together count for a total of 25 percent. (Do not forget to normalize the quiz scores.
They should be converted to percentages before they are averaged in.)
Any grade of 90 percent or more is an A, any grade between 80 and 89 percent is a B, any grade
between 70 and 79 percent is a C, any grade between 60 and 69 percent is a D, and any grade
below 60 percent is an F.
The program should read in the student’s scores and display the student’s
record, which consists of two quiz scores, two exam scores, the student’s total score for the entire
course, and the final letter grade. The total score is a number in the range 0 to 100, which
represents the weighted average of the student’s work.
Define and use a class for the student record. The class should have instance variables for the
quizzes, midterm, final, total score for the course, and final letter grade. The class should have
input and output methods. The input method should not ask for the final numeric grade, nor
should it ask for the final letter grade. The class should have methods to compute the overall
numeric grade and the final letter grade. These last two methods will be void methods that set the
appropriate instance variables. Remember, one method can call another method. If you prefer,
you can define a single method that sets both the overall numeric score and the final letter grade,
but if you do this, use a helping method. Your program should use all the methods described here.
Your class should have a reasonable set of accessor and mutator methods, whether or not your
program uses them.
You may add other methods if you wish.
